**1) We’ve created a layout that specifies what the app will look like.**
It includes a spinner, a button, and a text view.

We’ve added a label for the button, and an empty string for the brands.

**3) The activity specifies how the app should interact with the user.**
Android Studio has created a basic activity for us, but we haven’t done anything with it yet.
