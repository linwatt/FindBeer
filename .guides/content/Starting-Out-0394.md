You’re creating a brand-new app, so you’ll need to create a new project. Just like before, you’ll need to create a basic layout and activity.
Once you have a basic app set up, you need to amend the layout so that it includes all the GUI components your app needs.
The layout only creates the visuals. To add smarts to your app, you need to wire the layout to the Java code in your activity.
You’ll add a Java custom class to the app, and use it to make sure users get the right beer based on their selection.
1) Create Project
2) Update layout
3) Connect activity
4) Write Application Logic
